One of the best OpenERP's features is exporting custom data as CSV. That 
feature is as great and advanced as limited for an everyday experience.
A lot of customers want simply to export the tree view they are looking to.

Exporting to XML are much easier as long as yout target system handles this
format.


Usage

After you installed it, you'll find an additional link 'Export current Model'
right below the 'Export' one. By clicking on it you'll get a XML file contains
the same data of the Model you are looking at.
